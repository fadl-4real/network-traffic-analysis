🛡️ SQL Injection Detection & Exploitation Tool – Kali Linux
🚨 Built as part of my cybersecurity internship @ Uneeq Interns

This project automates the detection and exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities using Python on a Kali Linux VM. It includes network traffic capture with tcpdump and detailed packet analysis using Wireshark to understand attack patterns and normal traffic.

💡 Features
✅ Automated SQLi vulnerability detection with crafted payloads
✅ Exploitation module extracting database info from DVWA
✅ Network traffic capture using tcpdump
✅ Packet analysis with Wireshark including filters for ping, SYN flood, SQLi, and HTTPS traffic
✅ Clear guidance on SQLi mitigation and defense techniques
